Note: Without a forward slash on subfolder addresses, you might generate two requests to the server. Many servers will automatically add a forward slash to the address, and then create a new request.

* A local link (link to the same web site) is specified with a relative URL (without http://www....).
Example
<a href="html_images.asp">HTML Images</a> 

* The target attribute specifies where to open the linked document.
The target attribute can have one of the following values:
    _blank - Opens the linked document in a new window or tab
 <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/" target="_blank">Visit W3Schools!</a> 

* Always specify the width and height of an image. If width and height are not specified, the page will flicker while the image loads.


* A block-level element always starts on a new line and takes up the full width available (stretches out to the left and right as far as it can).
The <div> element is a block-level element.

* An inline element does not start on a new line and only takes up as much width as necessary.

This is an inline <span> element inside a paragraph.
